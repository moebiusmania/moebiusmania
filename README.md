# Salvatore Laisa aka Moebiusmania

### About me
I’m basically a passionate **nerd** 🤓, dev tech lead with 15+ years of experience in web & mobile development. 

I mainly work with **Javascript + HTML&CSS** (_and a bit of **Node.js**..._), but I've started with the good old Actionscript. In the latest years I had some minor experiences with **Flutter + Dart** for mobile applications and **Go** for backend web services. But rather than **fullstack** I prefer the **T-shaped** terminology to better describe my coding skills attitude.

Outside of work and coding you can find me drinking beers 🍻, visiting exhibitions 🖼️ , playing some videogames 🎮 (_on PC and Xbox_) or playing some low-end notes 🎵 on the bass.
