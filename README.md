# Salvatore Laisa aka @moebiusmania

### About me
I’m basically a passionate **nerd** 🤓, dev, tech lead with almost 20 years of experience in web development.

I've "grown up" as a frontend developer 👨‍💻 so my main stack is mostly Javascript oriented (_**HTML, CSS, JS, Node.js**_) but I had some minor experiences also with **PHP** and **Flutter**, but rather than **fullstack** I prefer the **T-shaped** terminology to better describe my coding skills attitude since I do also use a bit of databases, Docker, CI/CD even thought I'm not extremely proficient in those areas.

In the last 5-6 years I've switched to more "high-level" role as **team/tech lead** and **engineering manager**, but I always look to try to keep at least one hand in the codebases 😉. 

I'm also a coding instructor/coach 👨‍🏫 and I've mentored various classes in the ways of web development at [Mohole](https://scuola.mohole.it/) for many years.

Outside of work and coding you can find me drinking beers 🍻, visiting exhibitions 🖼️ , playing some videogames 🎮 (_on Steam Deck, Xbox and cloud services_) or playing some low-end notes 🎵 on the bass.
